"""
This unit generates test signatures and then verifies them.
It generates signatures for both variants of the signature format and
with various key sizes and exponents (3, 5, 7). Since a signature in the
BB'06 attack never wraps past modulus, we do not need a modulus, i.e.,
a full public key, to verify a signature. We only need the exponent part
of the public key. The BB'06 signatures are valid of any public key, provided
that the exponent matches (usually 3).
